I provide no-strings-attached consultations and complimentary home valuations to any potential client. Whether you're buying your first home or your 5th, whether you are selling, downsizing, investing, or anything in between, I prioritize education on the process, market updates and standards, valuation, and strategy. Real estate transactions are complex and involve several moving parts, and it's my job to stand by you every step of the way and help navigate you to the future you are dreaming of. Ever since I was a child, I've loved looking at houses, and I would dream about what my perfect house would look like. I have always been fascinated with architectural history and design; a fascination which later led me to study architectural drafting and interior design at The New York Institute of Art and Design. While designing unique interiors for each client, it became clear to me then that a house is not a home without someone to love it, and I began to pursue a life in real estate. Outside of my love of real estate and design, I am also passionate about painting, volunteering, playing music, and stargazing.

I am a lifelong Omaha resident. I grew up in midtown and I have always loved old homes and tree lined streets.I have watched Omaha grown over the decades and my comprehensive knowledge of the city can be put to work for you. After graduating from Creighton University in 2006 with a BSBA in Marketing my real estate career started in property management. I worked for a national real estate investment trust (REIT). I enjoyed working in the real estate industry and received my sales licence in 2010. I learned quickly that just like every home, every real estate transaction is different. I understand that this industry requires staying current in market trends, good communication and above all else honesty. I pride myself on protecting my clients interests with integrity and honesty. Real estate is not my only passion. Since receiving my license I married my best friend and we now have two daughters. Our four legged-fur kid is a Golden Retriever, Pearl. When I am not selling real estate or attending kid activites, my husband and I love to travel. I also enjoy spending time with my family, entertaining friends and being active. What can you expect when working with me? My clients work directly with me and we walk through the process of buying and/or selling a home together. The real estate market can be challenging but with proactive problem solving we can navigate it together. In my opinion, communication is key and is the foundation to success. A home is the biggest investment most of us will ever make. I hope that when it is time for you to make your dream come true you will allow me to help you see it through."

I also believe strongly in giving back to our community. It was my privilege to be involved in raising money for The Sunshine Kids Foundation, a wonderful organization who's sole focus is giving kids who are battling cancer every day, the childhood memories they deserve through trips, events and activities nationwide with other kids who have similar challenges.  I have raised over $90,000 for this organization, by sponsoring a huge annual fundraiser called Marchi Gras, a two night live music festival, at which all of the proceeds have gone to The Sunshine Kids Foundation.

Many of those years were spent as a Domestic and International Corporate Relocation specialist. As a well-connected professional within the Omaha business community, she has her finger on the pulse of local corporations. Kathy is truly at her best when there are multiple balls in the air and she can alleviate stress for her client, helping them make clear decisions. With a father who was a farmer and mother who was a schoolteacher, she learned what grit, perseverance and hard work were at a very early age. Not many realtors take on the roles of organizer, stager, photographer, handyman, therapist, housekeeper, painter, tour guide, savvy marketer and keen negotiator, but Kathy does it all. Give her the challenge and she will bring you the result. ""I consistently surprise people with an innate ability to make good things happen. I pay attention to every detail and will stand behind you every step of the way, developing a relationship of trust through knowledge, patience and good humor. I ensure that the process of negotiating the logistical, emotional and financial hurdles of your transaction will be made as easy as possible."" – Kathy Lanphier"

In 2005 we decided Nebraska was the place to raise a family and we moved home, and I continued my real estate career. Now I have a small team of realtors that work with me, and together we have a very well rounded group. From first time home buyers, to seasoned investors, land to commercial, we have the background to help you meet your real estate goals! My wonderful wife Wendy and I enjoy traveling, fine dining and spending time with family. We have 4 adult children, 3 dogs and not enough time to vacuum! In my spare time I'm a golf addict and I live and die with Cubs baseball and Husker Hoops and Football. I also enjoy playing around with the stock market with what little time I have.

My passions have always been taking care of people, creating a welcoming home environment and creative marketing / business strategies. I use these passions daily in my business. During the past 9+ years as a Realtor, I’ve been fortunate to have listed and sold homes throughout the Omaha Metro area. There is nothing quite like seeing a client’s eyes light up when they’ve found that perfect home or sensing their relief / excitement when they’ve received an offer on their home. I feel truly blessed to have found a career that allows me to be involved with my clients in a personal and impactful manner. It has been my experience that clients want someone they can trust to guide them through the process. I would be honored to help you or your friends and family find your dream home.

Christie elevates every stage of the real estate process with her warm, responsive professionalism and comprehensive, first-hand knowledge of the Omaha home market. Because Christie’s clients are often her neighbors—or referred to by her neighbors—she’s truly able to keep her finger on the pulse of what’s happening in the local market, and be a valued resource at every stage of the real estate process: from buying to renovating to selling. She understands that every home decision is part of a big-picture strategy. She has a strong sense of responsibility in being entrusted to guide her clients with her expertise and first-hand knowledge of Omaha real estate. As an Omaha native, a strong supporter of and volunteer with local charitable organizations and a mother of two school-aged children, Christie is invested in Omaha for life. She loves being the go-to when her clients have questions about anything— from ways to add value to your home or who to call for repairs, to fun local places to meet up with friends. “I find joy in the relationships, not just the transaction. I would rather exceed a client’s expectations and establish long-term rapport and trust rather than close a sale that may not be right.”"

Every time. Making Moves Happen in the Community for More Than 25 Years Serving Omaha, Elkhorn, Bellevue, Bennington, Gretna, La Vista, Papillion, Ralston and more! Two is Better Than One What makes us different from other real estate agents? Other than the fact that we truly do go above and beyond in all aspects of our job? (And, no, we're not afraid to say that.) With us, you're basically getting two for one. While you have one point of contact, you also have access to both of us and our strengths.

Ann Townsend Ann.Townsend@bhhsamb.com 402.706.3037 Residential Investment Specialist MRP (Military Referral Program) As part of a relocated family, Ann has the first-hand experience with all the emotions, stress and logistics of moving a household, family and life to a new city. With a father who is a disabled veteran, transitioning military families in and out of our community is her sweet spot. Ann and her husband used to own a real estate portfolio of 48 units until she decided to go into residential real estate in 2011. Now, with a real estate background, relocation experience, an accounting degree and community involvement, Ann is able to sell Omaha, find the right house and ensure her clients get the best prices for the house they are buying or selling. Ann uses all the tools available to ensure her clients get into their dream homes. Known for her honesty, integrity and dedication, Kathy always has the best interest of her buyers and sellers at heart. Ann works with the Omaha Chamber of Commerce, Omaha Children’s Hospital, Creighton University HCOB, ABIDE, Catholic Charities, JDRF and Little White Dog Rescue ""I am an agent you can trust to be at your side during the entire home-buying process. Exceeding expectations, responsive communication and personal customer service are hallmarks of my business. This high-level of service is what you can expect to receive as I use all tools available to ensure you end up in your dream home. Because you MATTER, I am always on your side."" – Ann Townsend Kathy Lanphier kathy.lanphier@bhhsamb.com 402.670.1040 Corporate Relocation Specialist Kathy has been a licensed real estate agent for more than 20 years now. Many of those years were spent as a Domestic and International Corporate Relocation specialist. As a well-connected professional within the Omaha business community, she has her finger on the pulse of local corporations. Kathy is truly at her best when there are multiple balls in the air and she can alleviate stress for her client, helping them make clear decisions. With a father who was a farmer and mother who was a schoolteacher, she learned what grit, perseverance and hard work were at a very early age. Not many realtors take on the roles of organizer, stager, photographer, handyman, therapist, housekeeper, painter, tour guide, savvy marketer and keen negotiator, but Kathy does it all. Give her the challenge and she will bring you the result. ""I consistently surprise people with an innate ability to make good things happen. I pay attention to every detail and will stand behind you every step of the way, developing a relationship of trust through knowledge, patience and good humor. I ensure that the process of negotiating the logistical, emotional and financial hurdles of your transaction will be made as easy as possible."" – Kathy Lanphier"
